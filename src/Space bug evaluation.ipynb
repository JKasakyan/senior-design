Usually this dangling trailing space is caused by removing \"#sarcasm\" --which overwhelmingly appears at the end of sarcastic tweets-- but that is not exclusively the case. Looking at the last example, \"#sarcasm\" is followed by \"#idiots\". Due to the underlying method of hastag removal in our methods, all hastags are removed. Thus \"#sarcasm\" and \"#idiots\" are removed and two dangling spaces remain. The tweet remains classified as sarcastic until the dangling trailing spaces are removed, at which point it is classified as serious. \n",

The wild swings in prediction/prediction probability produced by either keeping or removing the dangling space from the end of sarcastic tweets are not present regardless of which cleaning method is used. Across all tweets, the difference between using alternative_clean vs.  nlp.cleanTokensTwitter is negligible. This means that repr() was the main culprit behind the wild swings seen in the beginning of the notebook. It also means that the classifier was heavily relying on the influence repr() had on the features of a tweet to make a classification.\n",

Regardless of the cleaning method, the presence of a trailing period results in a significantly higher swing in prediction probabilty towards sarcastic. In some cases its removal was enough to swing the prediction entirely from sarcastic to serious. It's hard to tell whether or not this is an artifact from training the classifier on tweets where repr() was called as the first step in the pre-processing pipeline. It's possible that the quotes added by repr() altered the tokens at the end of a tweet and resulted in heavily weighting features that appeared near the end of tweets like periods and question marks."

    "The use of repr() had a significant impact on the classifier and made it appear to be extremely accurate, when in reality the classifier was heavily relying on programming artifacts resulting from the combination of calling repr() on tweet texts and tokenizing that output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the results of classification using the v2 classifier, we can see that classification and prediction probability are completely unaffected by trailing spaces. While tweets ending in periods versus the same exact tweet ending without a period may differ slightly in their prediction probability, the swing is not as dramatic as in V1 and most importantly doesn't rely on a programming artifact to reach that conclusion. One possible explanation is that in our twitter dataset there are simply more serious tweets ending with a period than sarcastic tweets ending with a period. Another possible explanation is that the choice of ending a tweet with a period versus omitting it is actually informative when determining whether the user who tweeted it was being sarcastic or not.
