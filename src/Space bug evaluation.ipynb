Usually this dangling trailing space is caused by removing \"#sarcasm\" --which overwhelmingly appears at the end of sarcastic tweets-- but that is not exclusively the case. Looking at the last example, \"#sarcasm\" is followed by \"#idiots\". Due to the underlying method of hastag removal in our methods, all hastags are removed. Thus \"#sarcasm\" and \"#idiots\" are removed and two dangling spaces remain. The tweet remains classified as sarcastic until the dangling trailing spaces are removed, at which point it is classified as serious. \n",
